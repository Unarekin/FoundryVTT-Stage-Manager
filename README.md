# Stage Manager

```
https://github.com/Unarekin/FoundryVTT-Stage-Manager/releases/latest/download/module.json
```


# Compability With Other Modules
- [Battle Transitions](https://github.com/Unarekin/FoundryVTT-Battle-Transitions) - If Battle Transitions is detected when Stage Manager initializes, it will move the former's PIXI layer between its own foreground and primary layers.  Further configurability options are planned for the future.
