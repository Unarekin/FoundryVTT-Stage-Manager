**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**System Information**
Please include your Foundry version (by number, rather than something like "latest") and platform -- are you running on Windows, Mac, hosted on Forge, etc.

**Other Modules**
Please include which game system you are using.
Disable (temporarily) any other modules and see if the bug still persists.
If it does not, then there is likely a compatibility issue between Stage Manager and another module.  A tool such as [Find the Culprit!](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/find-the-culprit/) can be very helpful in determining *which* other module.  Please include which module, if it's able to find one.
